- [ ] HTTP/HTTPS: Understanding the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure counterpart HTTPS is essential for analyzing web traffic and interactions between clients and servers.

- [ ] HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Knowledge of these fundamental web technologies is crucial for understanding how web pages are structured, styled, and scripted. This understanding helps in identifying vulnerabilities related to client-side scripting, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and HTML injection.
- [ ] Web Servers: Familiarity with web server technologies such as Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS is important for assessing server-side vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- [ ] Web Application Frameworks: Understanding popular web application frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Express.js is essential for identifying vulnerabilities specific to these frameworks and their associated technologies.
- [ ] SQL and NoSQL Databases: Knowledge of SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases is necessary for identifying vulnerabilities related to injection attacks, such as SQL injection and NoSQL injection.
- [ ] Authentication Mechanisms: Understanding various authentication mechanisms like HTTP Basic Authentication, form-based authentication, OAuth, and OpenID Connect is important for assessing the security of user authentication and authorization processes.
- [ ] Session Management: Knowledge of session management mechanisms and techniques, including session tokens, cookies, and session fixation, is essential for identifying vulnerabilities related to session management.
- [ ] Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Understanding how WAFs work and common evasion techniques is important for bypassing them during penetration testing.
- [ ] Content Management Systems (CMS): Familiarity with popular CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal is necessary for identifying vulnerabilities specific to these systems and their plugins/themes.
- [ ] APIs (RESTful, SOAP): Understanding how APIs are designed, implemented, and secured is important for assessing the security of web services and API endpoints.
- [ ] Web Application Security Standards: Knowledge of security standards such as OWASP Top 10, CWE/SANS Top 25, and Secure Coding Guidelines is essential for understanding common web application vulnerabilities and best practices for secure development.
